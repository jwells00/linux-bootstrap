# Custom global environment settings for this server.
# Files in /etc/profile.d are sourced in alphabetical order so if anything
# set in the other 01-custom-defaults.sh script is being overridden by other
# scripts in this directory, use this file for your custom setting instead
# since it begins with "ZZ-" and will be the last script run.
