# Linux Bootstrap

preferred environment settings and utility scripts.  The steps listed below
are primarily done on Oracle Linux (binary compatible with RHEL) servers that
have been provisioned in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

1. Ideally, provision a VM using the OCI Console or CLI.

2. Configure a profile/session for the new VM in your SSH terminal emulator
   of choice (SecureCRT, Putty, etc.) using the correct private key.

3. Logon to new VM as opc user and run configuration steps below.

cd repos
git clone https://github.com/jwells00/linux-bootstrap.git ./linux_bootstrap
